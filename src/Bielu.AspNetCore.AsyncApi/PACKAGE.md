## About

Bielu.AspNetCore.AsyncApi is a NuGet package that provides built-in support for generating AsyncAPI documents from minimal or controller-based APIs in ASP.NET Core.

This project is based on and inspired by:
- **[Saunter](https://github.com/asyncapi/saunter)** - The original AsyncAPI documentation generator for .NET
- **[Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi)** - Microsoft's OpenAPI implementation that inspired the API design
- **[ByteBard.AsyncAPI.NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ByteBard.AsyncAPI.NET/)** - AsyncAPI schema and serialization

## Key Features

* Supports viewing generated AsyncAPI documents at runtime via a parameterized endpoint (`/asyncapi/{documentName}.json`)
* Supports generating an AsyncAPI document at build-time
* Supports customizing the generated document via document transformers
* Support for protocol bindings (AMQP, HTTP, MQTT, Kafka, etc.)
* Multiple AsyncAPI document generation from a single application

## How to Use

To start using Bielu.AspNetCore.AsyncApi in your ASP.NET Core application, follow these steps:

### Installation

```sh
dotnet add package Bielu.AspNetCore.AsyncApi
```

### Configuration

In your Program.cs file, register the services provided by this package in the DI container and map the provided AsyncAPI document endpoint in the application.

```C#
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder();

// Registers the required services
builder.Services.AddAsyncApi(options =>
{
    options.AddServer("mosquitto", "test.mosquitto.org", "mqtt");
    options.WithDefaultContentType("application/json")
        .WithDescription("My API Description");
});

var app = builder.Build();

// Adds the /asyncapi/{documentName}.json endpoint to the application
app.MapAsyncApi();

app.Run();
```
